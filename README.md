STOP Abuse Tips:
>
>Tips to navigate: By forgiving and accepting repeated abuse, you’re reinforcing and enabling the behavior. 
>
>Your abusive partner will not change, it's not impossible but definitely not quick and easy. 
>
>If your partner has promised to stop the abuse, they'll repeat the abuse once you've forgiven them. 
>
>Don’t be trapped by confusion, guilt, or self-blame. You are not to blame for being mistreated.
>
>You are not the cause of your partner’s abusive behavior. You deserve to be treated with respect. 
>
>You and your children/family deserve a safe and happy life. You are not alone. Identify safe areas of the house (your community) Stay alert for signs and clues that your abuser is getting upset and may explode in anger or violence. 
>
>Practice escaping quickly and safely. Rehearse your escape plan so you know exactly what to do if under attack from your abuser. (I interpret this as: militia up your community, and keep in contact.
>
>  Get creative with some basic self defense.. There's no real escape.) 
>  Build as strong a support system as your partner will allow. 
>  Whenever possible, get involved with people and activities outside your home. .

I'm raising funds for helping buy signs and camera video equipment to monitor and prevent elder abuse and keep neighborhoods safety

Would you mind giving $50, $20, even just $10 or $5 to our cause?
